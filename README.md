# realtime-plate-recognition-yolo
#####  by Ahmet KARACALI
 A realtime license plate & car recognition program with Python & YOLO.

 Used Yolo3, Google Vision, Tensorflow & Keras to detect car & plate, then read the license plate. If you want to try the accuracy of the model I developed, just upload your own .mp4 file and get a google vision api key, then run realtime-plate-recognition.py. But please send me an email from akaracali58[at]gmail[dot]com address.I can send you the weights (h5) file.  You can see sample records inside detectionSamples folder.

 If you want to train your own model, please see train.py & train_bottleneck.py . You need to use your own training data, since mine is lost during years.
